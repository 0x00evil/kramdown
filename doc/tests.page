There exist several test suites for testing the correctness of a Markdown implementation. The
original [Markdown Test Suite](TODO) is the standard which one needs to test against. The [PHP
Markdown suite](TODO) contains the original test suite and several more tests (some specifically
geared towards the extension of the PHP Markdown Extra package). I have used the latter test tool to
verify the correctness of the Kramdown implementation. However, since the syntax used by Kramdown
varies slightly from standard Markdown some of the tests fail -- which is fine. When looking at the
differences one can see that the failures result from these differences.

Besides using the above mentioned test suite Kramdown comes with its own set of tests. These tests
are also used to verify the implementation and to spot regressions.

If you believe you have found a bug in the implementation, follow the outlined steps:

* Check the syntax page and see if the behaviour is not intended.

* If the behaviour is not intended and it seems that Kramdown should parse some text in another
  fashion, please open a bug report and attach two files: one with the text and one with the HTML
  conversion you think is correct.
