# Quick Reference

All examples below feature the kramdown source, the converted HTML source and the output as it
appears in the browser. This looks like this:

{::nokramdown:}
<div class="kdexample">
<pre class="kdexample-before"><code>kramdown example code
</code></pre>
<pre class="kdexample-after-source"><code>Example code converted to HTML
</code></pre>
<div class="kdexample-after-live">
Live browser view of example code
</div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
{::nokramdown:}


## Paragraphs

{::kdlink:: #paragraphs part="paragraphs"}

Paragraphs are separated by one or more blank lines:

{::kdexample:}
The first paragraph.

Another paragraph
{::kdexample:}

Explicit line breaks in a paragraph can be made by using two spaces or two backslashes at the end of a line:

{::kdexample:}
This is a paragraph  
which contains a hard line break.
{::kdexample:}


## Headers

{::kdlink:: #headers part="headers"}

kramdown supports Setext style headers and atx style headers. A header must always be preceeded by a
blank line except at the beginning of the document:

{::kdexample:}
First level header
==================

Second level header
-------------------
{::kdexample:}

{::kdexample:}
# H1 header

## H2 header

### H3 header

#### H4 header

##### H5 header

###### H6 header
{::kdexample:}

If you set the option `auto_ids` to `true` (for example, by using the `kdoptions` extension, see
TODO), then all headers are automatically given header IDs based on the header text:

{::kdexample:}
# A header without an ID

{::kdoptions:: auto_ids="true"}

# A header with an ID
{::kdexample:}


## Blockquotes

{::kdlink:: #blockquotes part="blockquotes"}

A blockquote is started using the `>` marker followed by an optional space; all following lines that
are also started with the blockquote marker belong to the blockquote. You can use any block level
elements inside a blockquote:

{::kdexample:}
> A sample blockquote.
> >Nested blockquotes are
> >also possible.
>
> ## Headers work too
> This is the outer quote again.
{::kdexample:}


## Code Blocks

{::kdlink:: #code-blocks part="code blocks"}

kramdown supports two different code block styles. One uses lines indented with either four spaces
or one tab whereas the other uses lines with tilde characters as delimiters -- therefore the content
does not need to be indented:

{::kdexample:}
    This is a sample code block.

    Continued here.
{::kdexample:}

{::kdexample:}
~~~~~~
This is also a code block.
~~~
Ending lines must have at least as
many tildes as the starting line.

{::kdexample:}
