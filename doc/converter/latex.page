# LaTeX Converter

This converter converts a kramdown element tree into LaTeX. It supports all available element types
except the HTML specific ones. The LaTeX document can, for example, further be converted to a PDF
file to produce a high quality, printable version.

Since the LaTeX converter outputs just the converted element tree and not a whole LaTeX document by
default, one should always use the `template` option (see below) to include the necessary
"framework".


## Hyper Targets and Links

Headers which have an ID set (either manually or, if the option `auto_ids` is set to `true`, an
automatically generated one -- for details on how the ID is generated see the [corresponding
section](html.html#auto-ids) of the HTML converter documentation) are available as hyper targets
within the LaTeX document. And in-document links (those starting with `#`) are transformed into an
hyper link. This means that when a PDF is generated from the LaTeX document, in-document links will
work correctly.


## Code Blocks

The LaTeX converter supports the visualisation of whitespace and syntax highlighting as specified in
the [HTML converter documentation](html.html#code-blocks). Syntax highlighting and visualizing
whitespace in a code block is done using the `listings` package. So all languages supported by the
`listings` package can be highlighted.


## Emphasis

The latex command `emph` is used for light and the command `textbf` for strong emphasis.


## Automatic "Table of Contents" Generation

If you add a "toc" reference to a list as described on the [HTML converter page](html.html#toc), the
list is replaced by the table of contents using the `\tableofcontents` command.


## Options

The LaTeX converter supports the following options:

{options: {items: [:auto_ids, :template]}}


{include_file: doc/links.markdown}
