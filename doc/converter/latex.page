# {title:}

This converter converts a kramdown element tree into LaTeX. It supports all available element types
except the HTML specific ones. The LaTeX document can, for example, further be converted to a PDF
file.

## Options

The LaTeX converter supports the following options:

{options: {items: [:template]}}
