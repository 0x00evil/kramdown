# {title:}

This converter converts a kramdown element tree into LaTeX. It supports all available element types
except the HTML specific ones. The LaTeX document can, for example, further be converted to a PDF
file to produce a high quality, printable version.

Since the LaTeX converter outputs just the converted element tree and not a whole LaTeX document by
default, one should always use the `:template` option (see below) to include the necessary
"framework".


## Code Blocks

Syntax highlighting and visualizing whitespace in a code block is done using the `listings` package.
So all languages supported by the `listings` package can be highlighted.


## Emphasis

The latex command `emph` is used for light and the command `textbf` for strong emphasis.


## Options

The LaTeX converter supports the following options:

{options: {items: [:template]}}
