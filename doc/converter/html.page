# HTML Converter

This converter converts a kramdown element tree into a HTML fragment and supports all available
element types.

## Code Blocks

A code block is wrapped in both `<pre>` and  `<code>` tags.

When showing whitespace in a code block, all spaces are replaced with the entity `&sdot;` and
additionally spaces and tabs in the code block are marked up using HTML `span` tags and the
following CSS classes:

* `ws-space-l`, `ws-tab-l`: leading spaces/tabs
* `ws-space-r`, `ws-tab-r`: trailing spaces/tabs
* `ws-space`, `ws-tab`: spaces/tabs in between

Syntax highlighting for text in a code blocks is done using the
[CodeRay](http://coderay.rubychan.de) library which can be installed, for example, via Rubygems.
Have a look at the CodeRay homepage to see all supported languages.


## Math Support

If you want math formulas correctly displayed, you have to include the [jsMath] javascript library
in the HTML file (see the [jsMath homepage][jsMath] for details). Note that kramdown does *not* ship
with the jsMath library and that therefore the `default` template does *not* include a link to it!

Why jsMath? Because I think that it is simply the best way to display LaTeX math formulas on the
Web.


## Emphasis

kramdown uses the HTML element `em` to style light and the element `strong` to style strong
emphasized text parts.


## Options

The HTML converter supports the following options:

{options: {items: [:template, :footnote_nr, :filter_html, :coderay_wrap, :coderay_line_numbers, :coderay_line_number_start, :coderay_tab_width, :coderay_bold_every, :coderay_css]}}
