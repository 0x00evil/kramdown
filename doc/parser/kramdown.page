# kramdown Parser

This is the main parser of the kramdown library (as the name suggests). It parses text in kramdown
syntax which is based on Markdown, a very easy to write, easy to read markup for writing HTML
documents in plain text. Since the basic Markdown syntax has some shortcomings, implementations
(especially the [PHP Markdown Extra] package) have tried to overcome this shortcomings with
additional syntax. The kramdown parser supports all features of the original Markdown syntax (albeit
with some minor corrections) as well as newer features implemented in the [PHP Markdown Extra]
package and [Maruku].

For a complete description of the implemented syntax, have a look at the [syntax
page](../syntax.html), the [quick reference](../quickref.html) provides a short overview.


## Conversion of HTML tags to native kramdown elements

If the option `html_to_native` is `true`, then the kramdown parser converts HTML tags that have a
native kramdown element representation to this representation. This is useful, for example, for
converters that cannot directly convert HTML tags.

Here is a description of the HTML tags that have native representations and how they are converted:

`em strong blockquote hr br a img li dt dd p thead tbody tfoot tr td th`
: These HTML tags are just transformed into their native representation and don't need any further
  processing.

`h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 h6`
: These six header tags are all mapped to the single `header` element with different header levels.

`code pre`
: The `code` tag is converted to a `codespan` element and the `pre` tag to a `codeblock` element.
  However, all child tags are removed and only the contained text is used.

`table ul ol dl`

: These tags are converted to their native element counterpart and all text (= whitespace) except
  inside nested

  - `td` or `th` tags for the `table` tag,
  - `li` tags for `ul` and `ol` tags,
  - `dt` and `dd` tags for the `dl` tag

  is removed.


## Options

The kramdown parser supports the following options:

{options: {items: [:parse_block_html, :parse_span_html, :html_to_native]}}
