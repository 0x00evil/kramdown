# kramdown Parser

This is the main parser of the kramdown library (as the name suggests). It parses text in kramdown
syntax which is based on Markdown, a very easy to write, easy to read markup for writing HTML
documents in plain text. Since the basic Markdown syntax has some shortcomings, implementations
(especially the [PHP Markdown Extra] package) have tried to overcome this shortcomings with
additional syntax. The kramdown parser supports all features of the original Markdown syntax (albeit
with some minor corrections) as well as newer features implemented in the [PHP Markdown Extra]
package and [Maruku].

For a complete description of the implemented syntax, have a look at the [Syntax
page](../syntax.html), the [quick reference](../quickref.html) provides a short overview.

## Options

The kramdown parser supports the following options:

{options: {items: [:parse_block_html, :parse_span_html]}}
