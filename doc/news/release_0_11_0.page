## kramdown 0.11.0 released

**Note**: The "internal" API (which is currently everything except the `Kramdown::Document` class)
has changed and developers may therefore need to update their extensions!

## Changes

* Major changes:

  - Link URLs in inline links and link definitions may now also contain spaces, even if not enclosed
    in angle brackets (requested by Matt Neuburg)
  - The kramdown converter produces nicer output, using the new option `line_width`

* Minor changes:

  - The HTML converter does not escape the quotation mark in code blocks anymore (requested by Matt
    Neuburg)
  - The order of HTML attributes and attributes defined via IALs and ALDs is now preserved
    (requested by Matt Neuburg)
  - Syntax highlighting is now supported in code spans when using the HTML converter (requested by
    Josh Cheek)
  - Updated `nomarkdown` extension and converters to support restricting the output to certain or
    all converters
  - Colons are now allowed in ID names for ALDs and IALs

* Bug fixes:

  - The LaTeX converter now removes trailing whitespace in footnotes (reported by Michael Franzl)
  - Fixed bug RF#28429: HTML output of `iframe` HTML element was invalid (reported by Matthew Riley)
  - Fixed bug RF#28420: LaTeX converter shouldn't escape the content of the `nomarkdown` extension
    (reported by Bj Wilson)
  - Fixed bug RF#28469: HTML "document" template did not work (reported by Vofa Ethe)
  - Fixed bug: HTML/kramdown output of `textarea` HTML element was invalid (reported by John Muhl)
  - Invalid or unknown extension tags are now left alone and not removed anymore

* Deprecation notes:

  - The option `numeric_entities` has been removed
