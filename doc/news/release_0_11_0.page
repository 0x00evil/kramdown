## kramdown 0.11.0 released

**Note**: The "internal" API (which is everything except the `Kramdown::Document` class) has changed
and developers may therefore need to update their extensions!

## Changes

* Minor changes:

  - The HTML converter does not escape the quotation mark in code blocks anymore (requested by Matt
    Neuburg)
  - The order of HTML attributes and attributes defined via IALs and ALDs is now preserved
    (requested by Matt Neuburg)

* Bug fixes:

  - The LaTeX converter now removes trailing whitespace in footnotes (reported by Michael Franzl)
  - Fixed bug RF#28429: HTML output of `iframe` HTML element was invalid (reported by Matthew Riley)

* Deprecation notes:

  - The option `numeric_entities` has been removed
