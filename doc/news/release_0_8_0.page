## kramdown 0.8.0 released

One of the bigger changes in this release is the support for converting HTML tags into native
kramdown elements via the new `html_to_native` option. For example, the HTML tag `p` is converted to
the native paragraph element instead of a generic HTML tag if this option is set to `true`. This is
especially useful for converters that don't handle generic HTML tags (e.g. the LaTeX converter).

Also note that support for the old extension syntax and custom extensions has been dropped as of
this release! And the `filter_html` option will be removed in the next release because there exist
better facilities for performing this kind of task!


## Changes

* Major changes:

  - Added the option `html_to_native` (default: `false`) which tells the kramdown parser whether to
    convert HTML tags to native kramdown elements or to generic HTML elements.

* Minor changes:

  - Table header cells are now represented by their own element type

* Bug fixes:

  - Attributes that have been assigned to the to-be-replaced TOC list are now added correctly on the
    generated TOC list in the HTML converter
  - Fixed problem in typographic symbol processing where an entity string instead of an entity
    element was added
  - Fixed problem with HTML span parsing: some text was not added to the correct element when the
    end tag was not found
  - HTML `code` and `pre` tags are now parsed as raw HTML tags
  - HTML tags inside raw HTML span tags are now parsed correctly as raw HTML tags

* Deprecation notes:

  - The old extension syntax and support for custom extensions has been removed.
  - The `filter_html` option will be removed in the next release.
