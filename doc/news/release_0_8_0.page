## kramdown 0.8.0 released

Support for the old extension syntax and custom extensions has been dropped as of this release.


## Changes

* Minor changes:

  - Table header cells are now represented by their own element type

* Bug fixes:

  - Attributes that have been assigned to the to-be-replaced TOC list are now added correctly on the
    generated TOC list in the HTML converter
  - Fixed problem in typographic symbol processing where an entity string instead of an entity
    element was added
  - Fixed problem with HTML span parsing: some text was not added to the correct element when the
    end tag was not found
  - HTML `code` and `pre` tags are now parsed as raw HTML tags
  - HTML tags inside raw HTML span tags are now parsed correctly as raw HTML tags

* Deprecation notes:

  - The old extension syntax and support for custom extensions has been removed.
