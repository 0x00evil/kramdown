## kramdown 0.9.0 released



## Changes

* Major changes:


* Minor changes:

  - Added option `numeric_entities` that defines whether entities are output using their names or
    their numeric values
  - Ruby 1.9 only: The HTML converter now always tries to convert entities to their character
    equivalences if possible.

* Bug fixes:


* Deprecation notes:

  - The `filter_html` option has been removed.
  - The method `Kramdown::Converter::Html#options_for_element` has been renamed to
    `html_attributes`, using the old name is deprecated and the alias will be removed in the next
    release
