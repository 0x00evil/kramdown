## kramdown 0.3.0 released


## Changes

* Major changes:

  - Added a compatibility fix so that kramdown works under Ruby 1.8.5 (requested by Steve Huff)

* Bug fixes:

* Deprecation notes:

  - The old extension names `kdoptions` and `nokramdown` have been removed, only the new names
    `options` and `nomarkdown` will work from now on.
