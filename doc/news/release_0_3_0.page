## kramdown 0.3.0 released


## Changes

* Major changes:

  - Added a compatibility fix so that kramdown works under Ruby 1.8.5 (requested by Steve Huff)
  - Complete overhaul of the used block HTML syntax and block HTML parser
  - Using the same semantics for invalid end tags and unclosed tags in the block and span HTML
    parser

* Bug fixes:

  - Fixed warnings on Ruby 1.9
  - Fixed bug in emphasis parser where emphasis started with an underscore at the beginning of a new
    line inside a paragraph was not recognized

* Deprecation notes:

  - The old extension names `kdoptions` and `nokramdown` have been removed, only the new names
    `options` and `nomarkdown` will work from now on.
