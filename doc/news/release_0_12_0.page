## kramdown 0.12.0 released

Some changes in the last release of kramdown lead to a performance drop. Therefore some performance
optimizations have been done resulting in about 15% less created objects (which reduces the garbage
collection pressure) and a small performance gain -- see the [tests page](../tests.html) for
detailed information.

The "internal" API (which is currently everything except the `Kramdown::Document` class) has changed
again and developers may therefore need to update their extensions! The API changes now allow
parsers and converters to be used without a Kramdown::Document class since this class is just
provided for convenience. All the needed information is now stored in the element tree itself.
Information that has no direct representation as an element is stored in the options of the root
element (e.g. footnote definitions). More information can be found in the API documentation.

## Changes

* 1 major change:

  - Added Markdown-only parser

* 3 minor changes:

  - Angle brackets can now also be escaped
  - Pipe characters in code spans that appear in tables do not need to be escaped anymore
  - New option `toc_levels` for specifying the header levels used for the table of contents
    (requested by Rick Frankel, RF#28672)

* 7 bug fixes:

  - Fixed output of HTML doctype in kramdown converter
  - Fixed output of paragraphs starting with a right angle bracket in the kramdown converter
  - Invalid span IALs are now left alone and not removed anymore
  - Option `entity_output` is now respected when outputting a non-breaking space for emtpy table
    cells in the HTML converter (reported by Matt Neuburg)
  - Fixed bug where a block IAL before a block HTML element was ignored (reported by Matt Neuburg)
  - Fixed bug where block IALs were falsely applied to nested elements (reported by Matt Neuburg)
  - Fixed bug RF#28660: Converting `<div><br /></div>` from HTML to kramdown resulted in stack trace
    (reported by Garrett Heaver)

* 1 deprecation note:

  - The option `toc_depth` is replaced by the new option `toc_levels` and will be removed in the
    next version.
