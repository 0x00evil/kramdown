## kramdown 0.5.0 released

The internals have been restructured slightly. So if you do more than just using the basic

    Kramdown::Document.new(SOURCE, OPTIONS).to_html
{: lang="ruby"}

you may need to adapt your code.


## Changes

* Minor changes:

  - Some code restructurations

* Bug fixes:

  - Fixed problem with multibyte encodings under Ruby 1.9
