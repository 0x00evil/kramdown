## kramdown 0.5.0 released

The internals have been restructured slightly. So if you do more than just using the basic

    Kramdown::Document.new(SOURCE, OPTIONS).to_html
{: lang="ruby"}

you may need to adapt your code.

Since the option handling has been revamped, each coderay option must not be set separably.


## Changes

* Major changes:

  - Enhanced the `kramdown` binary (it now supports setting the available options)

* Minor changes:

  - Some code restructurations
  - The quotation mark `"` is not converted to `&quot;` in normal text anymore.

* Bug fixes:

  - Fixed problem with multibyte encodings under Ruby 1.9
