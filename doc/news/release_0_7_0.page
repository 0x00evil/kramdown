## kramdown 0.7.0 released

This release adds syntax support for abbreviations. This means that kramdown is now syntax-wise on
par with Maruku and PHP Markdown Extra!

Additionally, the parser has been made non-configurable, i.e. the parser doesn't support options
anymore. This means that the intermediary stage after parsing will always be the same for one and
the same input document.

## Changes

* Major changes:

  - Added support for PHP Markdown Extra like abbreviations

* Minor changes:

  - The option `:auto_ids` has been moved from the parser to the converters.

* Bug fixes:

  - Fixed a problem with parsing smart quotes at the beginning of a line (reported by Michael
    Franzl)

* Deprecation notes:

  - Removed deprecated CLI option `-f`
