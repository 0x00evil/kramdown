## kramdown 0.7.0 released

This release adds syntax support for abbreviations. This means that kramdown is now syntax-wise on
par with Maruku and PHP Markdown Extra!

Another big change is the extension support: After some discussion on the mailing list (many thanks
to Eric Sunshine and Shawn Van Ittersum), the syntax for the extensions has been changed and support
for custom extensions will be dropped.

Additionally, the option `:auto_ids` has been moved from being interpreted by the parser to being
interpreted by the converters. This means that it is not possible anymore to turn automatic header
ID generation on or off for parts of a text.

## Changes

* Major changes:

  - Added support for PHP Markdown Extra like abbreviations
  - Added support for span extensions
  - New syntax for block/span extensions

* Minor changes:

  - The option `:auto_ids` has been moved from the parser to the converters.

* Bug fixes:

  - Fixed a problem with parsing smart quotes at the beginning of a line (reported by Michael
    Franzl)

* Deprecation notes:

  - Removed deprecated CLI option `-f`
  - The old extension syntax and support for custom extensions will be removed in the next release.
