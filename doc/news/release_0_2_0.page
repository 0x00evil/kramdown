## kramdown 0.2.0 released


## Changes

* Major changes:

  - Option `:auto_ids` now defaults to `true`
  - kramdown syntax is not processed anymore by default in HTML block tags
  - Added option for enabling/disabling parsing of HTML blocks/spans
  - Added recognition and usage of the "markdown" attribute for HTML block/span tags
  - Renamed extensions `kdoptions` to `options` and `nokramdown` to `nomarkdown` (suggested by Eric
    Sunshine)
  - Added support for setting header IDs via the syntax available in PHP Markdown Extra and Maruku

* Bug fixes:

  - Fixed bug that occured when using `:auto_ids=true` and an IAL for assigning an ID to a header
  - Fixed bug with parsing of autolinks (reported by Eric Sunshine)
  - Fixed some bugs regarding HTML parsing -- HTML parsing should work much better now (reported by
    Eric Sunshine)
  - Fixed bug with parsing of horizontal rules which contain tabs

* Deprecation notes:

  - The old extension names `kdoptions` and `nokramdown` will be removed in one of the next
    versions, use the new names `options` and `nomarkdown`.
