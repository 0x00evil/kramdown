  - The LaTeX converter now also outputs the element attributes on the end tag (requested by Michael
    Franzl)
  - New option `entity_output` for specifying how entities should be output
  - The underscore in the option names is now replaced with a hyphen for nicer CLI option names
  - Paragraphs that contain only an image are converted to figures in the LaTeX converter (requested
    by Michael Franzl)

* Bug fixes:

  - LaTeX converter now outputs line breaks correctly (reported by Michael Franzl)
  - Always outputting the entities `zcaron` and `Zcaron` numerically since browser support seems to
    be non-existing (reported by Eric Sunshine)
