## Welcome to the homepage of _kramdown_!

kramdown is a *free* (GPL-licensed) library for converting text in Markdown markup to HTML. Besides
supporting the basic Markdown markup, it also supports various extensions that have been made
popular by the [PHP Markdown Extra] package and [Maruku].

The [documentation page](documentation.html) explains the usage of the library and the [syntax
page](syntax.html) has detailed information about the available syntax.

## Download & Installation

The library and the accompanying binary have been successfully tested on the following platforms:

* Mac OSX with Ruby 1.8.6
* TODO: Linux with Ruby 1.8.6
* TODO: Windows XP with latest Ruby 1.8.6
* TODO: JRuby
* TODO: Ruby 1.9.1

If you are using Rubygems, installing the latest version of kramdown can simply be done by running

    gem install kramdown

The latest version of kramdown can also always be downloaded from [kramdown files section on
Rubyforge](http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=7403). After the download the package needs to be
decompressed and then you can install kramdown using the included `setup.rb` installation method:

    ruby setup.rb config
    ruby setup.rb setup
    ruby setup.rb install

kramdown uses git as its versioning system and kramdown's repository is hosted primarily on
Rubyforge but I have also created a clone of it on GitHub. The repositories always contains a clean
state of the current development version of kramdown, i.e. kramdown should always work when checked
out from the repository. To check out kramdown use one of the following commands:

     git clone git://rubyforge.org/kramdown.git
     git clone git://github.com/gettalong/kramdown.git
