### Changes

<webgen:block name='changes' />

--- name:notes pipeline:maruku

This is the first release of Kramdown, yet-another-Markdown converter for Ruby with the following
features:

* Written in pure Ruby, no need to compile an extension (like rdiscount)

* Fast (current impl ~5x faster than Maruku, ~10x faster than BlueCloth, although still slower than
  native code like rdiscount)

* Strict syntax definition (all special cases for which the original Markdown page does not account
  for are explicitly listed and it is shown how Kramdown parses them - see [Syntax] page)

* Supports common Markdown extension (similar to Maruku)

[Syntax]: ../syntax.html
