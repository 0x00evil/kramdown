.SH NAME
kramdown \- a fast, pure-Ruby Markdown-superset converter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B kramdown
[\fIoptions\fR]
[\fIFILE\fR ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
kramdown parses a superset of Markdown and converts it to different output formats. It is supports
standard Markdown (with some minor modifications) and various extensions like tables and definition
lists.

If \fIFILE\fR is not specified, kramdown reads from the standard input. The result is written to the
standard output.

There are two sets of options that kramdown accepts: The first one includes the options that are
used directly by the kramdown binary. The second set of options controls how kramdown parses and
converts its input.
